Title: Donate Money

AcoustID is an open source project developed completely in my spare
time and the service is provided to a growing list of open
source applications for free. If you find it helpful, please
consider donating a small amount of money. Your donation will
be used to support further development of the project and to
make sure the service stays both reliable and free.

The best way to donate is using Patreon:
